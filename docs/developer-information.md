# SIRIUS Developer information


You can use the libraries and the client libraries in your Java project,
either by using Maven or by including the jar files directly. The latter
is not recommended, as our libraries contains also dependencies to
external libraries. For detailed developer information please see our
GitHub repositories <https://github.com/boecker-lab>.
