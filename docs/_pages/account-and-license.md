Since SIRIUS 5, a user account and a license is required to use the webservice-based
features of SIRIUS.

**Non**-webservice-based features include molecular formula annotation using fragmentation trees and isotope pattern analysis -
this is performed on your local computer.
Webservice-based features are essentially advanced structure elucidation features including structure database search with CSI:FingerID
and CANOPUS compound class prediction.  
No worries these and upcoming features will stay free for academic/non-commercial use
and will be provided/hosted by the FSU Jena. On the other hand the [Bright Giant GmbH](https://bright-giant.com/) 
offers SIRIUS webservice hostings for commercial users. 

### Academic users
Non-commercial licenses will be granted (automatically) based on the domain of your 
institutional email address. So please use your institutional email address for your account
to benefit from free academic licenses.

The FSU Jena maintains an allow-list of academic/non-profit intuitions/organization. However, such a 
list will never be complete. If your Institution does not have access but should be, please 
[email](mailto:sirius@uni-jena.de) us with some information about your institution (e.g. official website) 
and we will grant you access. 

### Commercial users
Please contact Bright Giant (https://bright-giant.com/) for offerings and pricing.
