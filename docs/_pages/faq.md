## SIRIUS Import/Export
### How can I export result in SIRIUS 4.4 GUI?
SIRIUS 4.4 saves all results and data immediately to disk. This output is a well organized folder structure (project-space). 
If you have not specified any custom location (`SaveAs` button), SIRIUS stores everything in a temporary location per default. 
You can see the path of current project-space location in the header of the SIRIUS window.
